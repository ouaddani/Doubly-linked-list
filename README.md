# Doubly-linked-list
this is an example of doubly linked list, throughout manipulation of pointers we will be able to perform many tasks as: 
* 1.creating nodes .
* 2.displaying our list .
* 3.inserting new nodes either at the begining or end or just somewhere the list.
* 4.deleting nodes by the consideration of diffrent states..

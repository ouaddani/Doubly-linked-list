# Doubly-linked-list:
this is an example of doubly linked list, throughout manipulation of pointers we will be able to perform many tasks as: 
* Creating nodes .
* Displaying our list .
* Inserting new nodes either at the begining or end or just somewhere the list.
* Deleting nodes by the consideration of diffrent states.
